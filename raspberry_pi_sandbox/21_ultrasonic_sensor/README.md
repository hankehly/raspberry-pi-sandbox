# Lesson 21 Homework Solution - Ultrasonic Sensor with LED

When duration = 1 ms we measure 17.15 cm.
17.15 cm is the time it takes to go from the sensor to the object and back, so if we removed the object, the sound would have travelled 17.15 * 2 = 34.3 cm.
1 second is 1000 ms, so in 1 second sound should travel 17.15 * 1000 * 2 cm = 34300 cm.
The speed of sound is 34300 cm/s!
